This post is just me noting down some realistic goals for this site.

1. I should make a script that creates and opens a new post file for this blog. 
	* Maybe the script could even push the file to the repo.
2. Navigation Bar. I've got to get me a navigation bar on this site and lay the foundation for good navigation on this site


Hey Future me!

Whats my progress on these?
