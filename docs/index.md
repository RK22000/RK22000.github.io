Every once in a while I'll have the urge to write something that I want to 
share with someone else or my future self. Normally I'd just pester my room 
mate with such random thoughts, or I'd ignore them by convincing myself that I 
haven't got a good place or audience to write such thoughts for. 

Not any more! 

Now I'm spending 2 days trying to make a [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) 
to procrastinate on actually writing down my random thoughts while 
procrastinating on 3 homework assignments that could almost drop me down a 
grade point. (`\*_\*)>
