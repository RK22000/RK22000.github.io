# RK22000.github.io on branch tutorial
This branch is the result of me working through this [Jekyll tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)

I've wanted to make some kind of a blog site for a while now and when I saw what Jekyll was I thought it was perfect for what I wanted. 
So I worked through [this tutprial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) to get grasp of what Jekyll is capable of.

As of right now I've completed the tutorial so I'd say the next thing I want to try out would be to apply some templates to this tutorial project.
Once I see what applying a template is like I'll kick off my blog.
